## Schedule

| Meeting Date | Topic | Learning objective | Technical skills |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 : Jan 23 | What is your birthquake? | Be introduced to using the Jupyter notebook environment and using it to access and inspect data. | *Defining variables and accessing tabular data through an API.* Use Python code within a Jupyter notebook to access an online API to pull in and inspect tabular data using `pandas`. |
| Week 1 assignment | Maps | Develop an understanding of map projections and visualizations of geospatial data. | *Map generation.* Learn to generate maps using `cartopy` using different projections and to plot locations. |
| Week 2 : Jan 30 | Earth's continents and oceans | Compare the distribution of Earth's topography (hypsometry) to a normal distribution. Explain the distribution in terms of continental crust vs. oceanic crust density. | *Simple statistics and data visualization.* Use `numpy` to load data and do simple statistical calculations such as `np.mean`. Use the `matplotlib` to visualize distributions of data as histograms and cumulative distributions. |
| Week 2 assignment | Seafloor age and plate tectonics | Use global seafloor age distribution to make inferences about plate tectonic processes. | *Tabular data wrangling and visualization.* Get further introduced to the `pandas` library. Use `cartopy` functions to visualize geospatial data in order to identify patterns. |
| Week 3 : Feb 6 | Global earthquakes and plate tectonics | Illuminate plate boundaries by plotting global earthquakes. Visualize a subducting plate by examining earthquakes in the Andes. | *Data wrangling and visualization.* Continue use of the `pandas` library as well as `matplotlib` and `cartopy` functions. |
| Week 3 assignment | Global earthquakes and seismograph interpretation | Make connections between earthquake magnitude/depth and plate boundary type. Analyze a seismograph and relate differential wave travel times to distance using established time-travel curves. | *Continued data wrangling and visualization; calculations.* Continued use of the `pandas` library as well as `matplotlib` and `cartopy` functions to visualize data. Use Python to make calculations related to Earthquake distance. |
| Week 4 : Feb 13 | Seafloor spreading and crustal magnetism | Use bathymetry data in combination with marine magnetic anomaly data to evaluate seafloor spreading. Interpret the distance from the spreading ridge where the last geomagnetic reversal happened across different spreading ridges and use this distance to calculate spreading rate. | *Data filtering and detrending* Indexing, filtering and cleaning data using `pandas`. Declare a function to detrend and filter magnetic anomaly data. |
| Week 4 assignment | Seafloor spreading | Use expanded age pick data sets from multiple ocean basins and determine seafloor spreading rates through applying linear regression. | *Correlation and regression* Use the `numpy` `polyfit` function to develop linear least-squares regressions for data and the `polyval` data to use these regressions to model a process for two sets of measurements. Use the `scipy` `stats.linregress` function to calculate related summary parameters. | 
| Week 5 : Feb 20 |	No class (President's Day)	| 	 
| Week 6 : Feb 27	| Probabilities applied to Earth and planetary processes | Discuss different statistical distributions and the concepts of theoretical versus empirical distributions. Consider probability distributions applied to meteor showers and earthquake occurence and the geomagnetic field .  | *Monte Carlo simulation* Use the module `numpy.random` to generate examples of simulated data sets.
| Week 6 assignment	| Earth's reversing magnetic field | Earth's geomagnetic polarity timescale. Consider the time series of geomagnetic reversals and how reversal frequency could be represented with probability distributions. | Implement additional probability distributions using `scipy` including the gamma distribution |
